’d really appreciate your 10 minute review of the results section (and in light of the limitations described below, additional things that you suggest looking into and adding--I had Ngan check and verify these analyses as well!). Thank you so much Jenny!!!


limitation1: looking at specific disaster domain-- the specific extreme events disaster domains might not be an accurate indicator for climate vulnerability, bc I think Roberson didn’t hit even top 20 for flooding, precipitation, and storms indicators. I think that in terms of climate vulnerability and resilience to power outages, the overall CVI and baseline indicators might be a better representation of areas to prioritize for individuals who rely on DME.


Limitation 2: I didn’t see any information on historical power outages in either the Empower publicly available data/the Empower map on the Empower website, nor in the data dictionary for the CVI indicators. I think that the power outages might be something I can look for in outside publicly available data, but not in time for the abstract submission

Lund, Jennifer L
Cool - my thoughts re: limitations


1. This may be based on the year that the CVI is pulling from for disaster data. I don't think I see that mentioned in your methods. Can you clarify? Also, I am 100% fine to focus on the overall CVI for this abstract. The counties make sense and I think the analysis looks good.


2. Yes, to my knowledge there is no readily identified publicly available source for power outage data. I would LOVE to find it! Would be great if you and Ngan wanted to poke around a bit. Joyce might be able to ask about this in her class (geography/climate change) - but it might be a bit off topic.

Okie! I will add the years of disaster/climate preparedness and baseline data into the methods!! Thank you SO MUCH! lol YES Ngan and I and Joyce will poke around in the interim :)

population-based cohort study that was designed to understand differences in prostate cancer outcomes between Black and White men. Uniquely, recruitment and home visits occurred in real time with self-reported questionnaire data for participants both pre- and post Katrina.
These work will be also the basis for application for an F31

September 2004, but were halted in August of 2005. following Hurricane Katrina and its impact on New Orleans and the surrounding region.
Home visits in Louisiana resumed in September 2006 and ended in August of 2009. During the ‘post-Katrina’ phase expanded the catchment areas in in Louisiana for a total of 21 parishes

Jeanny Wang. My training has been across many tracks in epidemiology. Current research in progress include describing climate vulnerability and utilization of DME among Medicare beneficiaries using the HHS empower program. Work this summer will extend to mapping with historical data on storms and power outages from the DOE, which will be presented in August at the ISPE.
In addition, I am completing a study on patient-provider communication and prostate cancer treatment in the PCaP. I am currently also developing my dissertation, where I hope to describe the short and long0term impacts of hurricane Katrina on cancer care among prostate cancer patients in Louisiana.

- DElphi method [i hate learned helplessness and ewaponized incompetence ]
its like..oh no don't do the most, stop doing the most stop stop stpo
Hurricane vs storms (what are you really trying to measure)
- do not be the mentee who does the most. stop please
- tropical storms (per population level historic climate data)
